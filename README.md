# CatFoodFeeder
This is the code I am using to run my automated cat food feeder AKA... The Fancy Feast Ferris Wheel!

The program reads if the button has been pushed or not. When the button is pushed, the stepper motor will turn dispensing the cat food. Clicking the button again stops the motor from turning. 

A video of the Fancy Feast Ferris Wheel will be posted on my YouTube channel --> Calista Greenway .
